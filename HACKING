As of version 0.8 MathMap features a compiler in addition to the
interpreter. Thus, all builtins must be available in two versions,
namely for the intepreter and the compiler. To accomplish this without
manually writing the two version, I have put to use the chpp
preprocessor (http://www.unix.cslab.tuwien.ac.at/chpp/). It creates
both versions from builtins.chc.

If you want to write your own builtins or modify existing ones, you
need at least version 0.3.4 of chpp. If you have any problems
understanding builtins.chc (it's a little hard if you are not used to
chpp) I'd be glad to help you. Just drop me a mail.
