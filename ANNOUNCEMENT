MathMap 0.7
-----------

MathMap is a GIMP plug-in which allows distortion of images specified
by mathematical formulas. For each pixel in the generated image, an
expression is evaluated which should return a pixel value. The
expression can either refer to a pixel in the source image or can
generate pixels completely independent of the source. MathMap not only
allows the generation of still images but also of animations.

The MathMap homepage can be found at

    http://www.unix.cslab.tuwien.ac.at/~schani/mathmap/

It includes a user's manual as well as screenshots and examples.

Changes since 0.6:

  * Implemented the tagged tuples type system. This is major feature!

  * Implemented better error handling by borrowing a piece of code from
    the current development tree of chpp.
