MathMap 0.8
-----------

MathMap is a GIMP plug-in which allows distortion of images specified
by mathematical formulae. For each pixel in the generated image, an
expression is evaluated which should return a pixel value. The
expression can either refer to a pixel in the source image or can
generate pixels completely independent of the source. MathMap not only
allows the generation of still images but also of animations.

The MathMap homepage can be found at

    http://www.unix.cslab.tuwien.ac.at/~schani/mathmap/

It includes a user's manual as well as screenshots and examples.

Changes since 0.7:

  * Now runs under both GIMP 1.0 and GIMP 1.1.

  * Features a transparent MathMap->C compiler under GIMP 1.1 boosting
    performance by a factor 2 to 8.

  * Simple vector and matrix algebra.

  * Pixels outside the image can now be either wrapped or given any
    color (including transparency).
