    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <blockquote>
      MathMap is a <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> plug-in
      which allows distortion of images specified by mathematical
      formulae. For each pixel in the generated image, an expression
      is evaluated which should return a pixel value. The expression
      can either refer to a pixel in the source image or can generate
      pixels completely independent of the source.

      <p>If you have any suggestions, bugs to report, expressions
      which generate cool effects, or if you just happen to like or
      dislike this plug-in, in other words, under any circumstances,
      please <a href="mailto:schani@complang.tuwien.ac.at">drop me a
      mail</a>.

      <h3>Changes since 0.11</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Requires at least GIMP 1.1.26.

	<li>MathMap now has a GIMP-independent command line version.

	<li>Much improved complex arithmetic (thanks to Hans
	  Lundmark).

	<li>New/improved functions: scale, toRGBA, toHSVA, gamma,
          sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh, arg, conj, exp (most
          of them contributed by Hans Lundmark).

	<li>Some bug fixes.
      </ul>

      <h3>Changes since 0.10</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Requires at least GIMP 1.1.

        <li>More than one input image can be specified!!!

        <li>MathMap now registers all examples in the PDB.

      <ul>
        <li>Expressions can now contain values which the user can
          specify through the GUI (numbers, colors, booleans,
          curves). This is a <b>mega-feature</b>!

	<li>Pixels outside the image can now also be reflected back
	  into the image (thanks to <a href="mailto:eric.kidd@pobox.com">Eric Kidd</a>).

	<li>More matrix/vector algebra (including gaussian elimination).

	<li>The positive Y-axis direction is now upwards which is clearly
	  The Right Thing.

	<li>Some minor C code generator changes which should not affect the
	  user but easy writing of built-ins.

	<li>New/improved functions: print.

	<li>Some bug fixes.
      </ul>

      <h3>Changes since 0.8</h3>

      <ul>
	<li>Lots of bug fixes.

            GIMP 1.1 boosting performance by a factor 2 to 8.

        <li>Simple vector and matrix algebra.

        <li>Pixels outside the image can now be either wrapped
            or given any color (including transparency).
      </ul>

      <h3>Changes since 0.6</h3>

      <ul>
	<li>Implemented the <a href="taggedtuples.html">tagged
	    tuples</a> type system. This is a <b>major</b> feature!

	<li>Implemented better error handling by borrowing a piece of
	  code from the current development tree of <a
	    href="http://chakotay.ml.org/">chpp</a>.
      </ul>

    <h2>Bugs and Deficiencies</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The coordinate system is fixed: the origin is always at the
	center of the image and a unit is always a pixel.

      <li>Tuples are limited to a size of 9 in the interpreter.
    </ul>

    <h2>What's to come</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>I'll try to fix all the bugs.</li>

      <li>I'll let the user specify the coordinate system (origin, scale).

      <li>I will make it possible for the user to modify the Examples
	tree from within the plug-in in a user-friendly fashion.
	
      <li>I will add a few optimizations to the code generator.
    </ul>

    <h2>How you can contribute</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Play around with MathMap. If you have any suggestions, mail
        me. If you find any bugs, try to reproduce them and mail me
	a bug report or, better yet, try to fix them yourself and mail
	me a patch if you succeed.

      <li>Write cool MathMap expressions and mail them to me.

      <li>If you want a particular feature, mail me or implement it
        yourself and send me the patch.

      <li><b>Write a tutorial!</b> I believe the main reason why
        MathMap is not widely used yet is that it's missing a cool
        tutorial which teaches MathMap step-by-step. The reasons I'm
        not writing it (which are of course mere digressions from the
        fact that I'm just plain lazy :-)) is that I'm already far too
        busy with coding and that I'm not a very good tutorial writer,
        probably because I'm far too technical and thus have a skewed
        perspective. Thus, if you understand MathMap and are not too
        bad a writer, please consider writing a tutorial!
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to get it</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Get the source of version 0.12 <a href="mathmap-0.12.tar.gz">here</a>. 
      You'll need <tt>bison</tt> and <tt>flex</tt> in order to compile it
      (both are included in any sane operating system distribution).
      <b>Note:</b> Version 0.11 requires GIMP 1.1! The last version that
      runs under GIMP 1.0 is <a href="mathmap-0.10.tar.gz">version 0.10</a>.
