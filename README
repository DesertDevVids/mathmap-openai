MathMap 1.3.0
=============

MathMap is a plug-in for The GIMP and a standalone command-line
utility for image and animation manipulation.

The newest version is always available from the MathMap home-page:

    http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/schani/mathmap/

There is a Google discussion group for MathMap here:

    http://groups.google.com/group/mathmap

Feel free to subscribe and participate.  It's the primary place for
questions, bug reports and suggestions.  New releases will be
announced there, too.

See INSTALL on how to build and install MathMap.

If you want to get the absolutely latest MathMap sources from our
Mercurial repository, please read README.mercurial.

See doc/language.html for a language tutorial with nice pictures (very
useful if you are new to MathMap) and doc/reference.html for a
language reference.  NOTE: The new language features in the 1.3 branch
are not documented in the reference, yet.  Please consult
README.filters or go here:

Note also: The command line version of MathMap is not very thoroughly
tested and probably has lots of bugs.  The QuickTime Movie support in
the command line version is ancient and has not been tested at all for
this release, so it will probably not work.  Please report any
problems you have with it.
