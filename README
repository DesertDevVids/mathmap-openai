MathMap is a plug-in for The GIMP and a standalone command-line
utility for image and animation manipulation.

It was designed and written by Mark Probst.

The newest version is always available from the MathMap home-page:

	http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/~schani/mathmap/

See INSTALL on how to build and install MathMap.

If you have any suggestions, bug reports, criticism or even
contributions, don't hesitate mailing me.

Note: The GIMP plug-in version of MathMap only works with GIMP 1.1.26
and up.
