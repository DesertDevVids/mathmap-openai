MathMap is a plug-in for The GIMP.

It was designed and written by Mark Probst.

The newest version is always available from the MathMap home-page:

	http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/~schani/mathmap/

MathMap now features a command-line version. See INSTALL on how to
build it. It's still very crude though. Mail me if you use it and need
more features.

If you have any suggestions, bug reports, criticism or even
contributions, don't hesitate mailing me.

Note: This version of MathMap only works with GIMP 1.1.26 and up.
