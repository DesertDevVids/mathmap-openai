MathMap 1.1.3
=============

MathMap is a plug-in for The GIMP and a standalone command-line
utility for image and animation manipulation.

The newest version is always available from the MathMap home-page:

    http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/schani/mathmap/

See INSTALL on how to build and install MathMap.

See doc/language.html for a language tutorial with nice pictures (very
useful if you are new to MathMap) and doc/reference.html for a
language reference.

If you have any suggestions, bug reports, criticism or even
contributions, don't hesitate to mail me.

Note: The command line version of MathMap is not very thoroughly
tested and has probably lots of bugs.  The QuickTime Movie support in
the command line version is ancient and has not been tested at all for
this release, so it will probably not work.  Please report any
problems you have with it.
