Installing MathMap
==================

This development version has only been tested on Linux (Fedora Core
6), and will probably not work on other operating systems without some
adjustments.

Requirements
------------

MathMap requires the following software packages, including
development packages, to compile and to run:

  * The GIMP 2.2
  * GSL (GNU Scientific Library), including GSL CBLAS
  * libjpeg, libpng, libgif

Configuration
-------------

Edit the Makefile if necessary.  Usually you shouldn't have to do
this, unless you have more than one version of GIMP installed.

Compiling
---------

After you are finished with the Makefile, just type

	make

If it does not work, the most probable cause is that you don't have
all the required packages (see above) installed.  Consult the
documentation of your Linux distribution or whatever you have on how
to install packages.  The packages you're looking for are probably
called something like "gimp-devel" and "gsl-devel" or just "gsl".

Installation
------------

If you want to install mathmap on your account, type

	make install

If you have compiled the plug-in version and want to install the
national language translations, become root and type

	make install-mos

If you have any problems with this process, feel free to contact me.
