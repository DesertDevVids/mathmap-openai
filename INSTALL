Edit the Makefile if necessary. These are, amongst more obscure
things, the reasons why you might have to do this:

  * You are building on an Alpha. If you don't know what an Alpha is,
    this does not apply to you.

  * You don't have a gcc/glibc system. If you use a recent Linux
    distribution, this does not apply to you.

  * If you want to build the command line version instead of the GIMP
    plug-in.

  * You don't have gettext or do not want localization.

After you are finished with the Makefile, just type

	make

It should compile on most systems.

If you want to install mathmap on your account, type

	make install

If you have compiled the plug-in version and want to install the
national language translations, become root and type

	make install-mos
