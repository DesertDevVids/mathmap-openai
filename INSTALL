Edit the Makefile if necessary. These are, amongst more obscure
things, the reasons why you might have to do this:

  * You are building on an Alpha. If you don't know what an Alpha is,
    this does not apply to you.

  * You don't have a gcc/glibc system. If you use a recent Linux
    distribution, this does not apply to you.

  * If you want to build the command line version instead of the GIMP
    plug-in.

After you are finished with the Makefile, just type

	make

It should compile on most systems.

If you want to install mathmap on your account, type

	make install
