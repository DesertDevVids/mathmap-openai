In case you don't have libPropList installed on your system, do the
following in this directory:

	tar -zxf libPropList.tar.gz
	cd libPropList
	./configure
	make
	cd ..

If you are using GIMP 1.1 and/or are building on an Alpha, edit
Makefile and follow the comments there.

Then just type

	make

It should compile on most systems.

If you want to install mathmap on your account, type

	make install
