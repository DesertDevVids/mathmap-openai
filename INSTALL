Installing MathMap
==================

This version of MathMap has only been tested on Linux and will
probably not work on other operating systems without some adjustments.
We provide packages for several Linux distributions as well as
versions for Windows and MacOS X.  Is is recommended that you use
these rather than compiling MathMap yourself, if possible.  They are
available on the MathMap homepage:

    http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/schani/mathmap/

Requirements
------------

MathMap requires the following software packages, including
development packages, to compile and to run:

  * The GIMP 2.2 or 2.4
  * GSL (GNU Scientific Library), including GSL CBLAS
  * libgtksourceview
  * libgnomecanvas2

If you want MathMap to have a command-line interface as well (which is
optional), you'll also need the following libraries:

  * libjpeg, libpng, giflib

Configuration
-------------

Edit the Makefile if necessary.  Usually you shouldn't have to do
this, unless you have more than one version of GIMP installed or want
to build the command-line interface as well.

Compiling
---------

After you are finished with the Makefile, just type

	make

If it does not work, the most probable cause is that you don't have
all the required packages (see above) installed.  Consult the
documentation of your Linux distribution or whatever you have on how
to install packages.  The packages you're looking for are probably
called something like "gimp-devel" or "libgimp-dev", or just "gimp".

Installation
------------

If you want to install mathmap for all users on your machine
(recommended), become root and type:

	make install

If instead you want to install mathmap only on your account, type
(without becoming root or using a tool like "checkinstall"):

	make install-local

Note: The command-line interface will not work if you install MathMap
only for your account!

If you have compiled the plug-in version and want to install the
national language translations (this is not tested for this
development release), become root and type

	make install-mos

If you have any problems with this process, feel free to contact me.
