Installing MathMap
==================

Edit the Makefile if necessary.  These are, amongst more obscure
things, these reasons why you might have to do this:

  * You want to build for GIMP 1.2 instead of the new GIMP 2.0.

  * You are building on MacOS X.  This is only tested with GIMP 1.2 on
    Fink.

  * You are building on an Alpha. If you don't know what an Alpha is,
    this does not apply to you.

  * If you want to build the command line version instead of the GIMP
    plug-in.  For additional animation support, you must have
    libquicktime installed, which you can get from this URL:

      http://heroinewarrior.com/quicktime.php3

  * You don't have gettext or do not want localization.

After you are finished with the Makefile, just type

	make

It should compile on most systems.  If it does not work, the most probable
cause is that you do not have either the GIMP development package or the GSL
library installed.  Consult the documentation of your Linux distribution or
whatever you have on how to install packages.  The packages you're looking for
are probably called something like "gimp-devel" and "gsl-devel" or just "gsl".

If you want to install mathmap on your account, type

	make install

If you have compiled the plug-in version and want to install the
national language translations, become root and type

	make install-mos

If you have any problems with this process, feel free to contact me.
