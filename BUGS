Known Bugs
==========

GIMP Plug-In
------------

switching to the examples tab for the first time automatically selects
the first item.  if it's an expression, it automatically is activated.

when there are no user values the user values tab doesn't scale when window is resized

should ask to save before quitting or selecting another expression

i18n is terribly old.  maybe we should axe it?

Compiler
--------

Two inputs can have the same name

Why is there no error message when i assign to "r"???
